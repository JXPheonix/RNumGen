Hi! Welcome to RNumGen.

This project was originally created by JXPheonix, but since it is open source you can do whatever you want with it!

If you plan on forking this app, please keep everything above this line and edit below this line.

Right now we don't have anything here, but as soon as possible I plan to push my first draft of the program here.
It's an android app which basically generates random numbers from the range you choose from.
So lets get this open source party started!
